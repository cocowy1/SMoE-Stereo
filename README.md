# üöÄ SMoE-Stereo (ICCV 2025) üöÄ 
[ICCV 2025] üåüüåü Learning Robust Stereo Matching in the Wild with Selective Mixture-of-Experts

##  üåº Abstract
Our SMoE-Stereo framework fuses Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a Selective-MoE design to unlock robust stereo matching at minimal computational cost. Its standout features are üòÑ :
* Our SMoE dynamically selects the **most suitable experts** for each input and thereby adapts to varying input characteristics, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to diverse ‚Äúin-the-wild‚Äù scenes and domain shifts.
  
* Unlike existing stereo matching methods that rely on rigid, sequential processing pipelines for all inputs, SMoE-Stereo intelligently prioritizes computational resources by selectively engaging only **the most relevant MoEs** for simpler scenes. This adaptive architecture optimally balances accuracy and processing speed according to available resources.

* Remarkably, despite being trained exclusively on standard datasets (KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D training splits) without additional data, SMoE-Stereo has achieved top ranking on the Robust Vision Challenge (RVC) leaderboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
* NVIDIA RTX a6000
* Python 3.8.13

### ‚è≥ Create a virtual environment and activate it.

```Shell
conda create -n smoestereo python=3.8
conda activate smoestereo
```
### üé¨ Dependencies

pip install tqdm
pip install scipy
pip install opencv-python
pip install scikit-image
pip install tensorboard
pip install matplotlib 
pip install timm==0.5.4
pip install thop

## ‚úèÔ∏è Required Data

* [SceneFlow](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html)
* [KITTI](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo)

|sceneflow | [Download  ][Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoY7Yam0MA2qUI1GIVll0owH4tMTpzw7?usp=drive_link)|
|RVC (mix of all training datasets) [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UoY7Yam0MA2qUI1GIVll0owH4tMTpzw7?usp=drive_link)|

The mix_all model is trained on all the datasets mentioned above, which has the best performance on zero-shot generalization.


## ‚úàÔ∏è Evaluation

To evaluate the zero-shot performance of MonSter on Scene Flow, KITTI, ETH3D, vkitti, DrivingStereo, or Middlebury, run

```Shell
python evaluate_stereo.py --restore_ckpt ./pretrained/sceneflow.pth --dataset *(select one of ["eth3d", "kitti", "sceneflow", "vkitti", "driving"])
```
or use the model trained on all datasets, which is better for zero-shot generalization.
```Shell   
python evaluate_stereo.py --restore_ckpt ./pretrained/mix_all.pth --dataset *(select one of ["eth3d", "kitti", "sceneflow", "vkitti", "driving"])
```
